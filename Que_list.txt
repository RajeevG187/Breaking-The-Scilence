}
Non_custodial_rape.csv
{
Can you identify any patterns or trends in the type of rape cases (e.g., rape of pregnant women, rape of women below 16 years of age) across different regions?
How do the types of rape cases vary by age groups of the victims?
Are there any correlations between the attributes, such as the number of repeated rape cases and the punishment imposed by law?
What is the distribution of rape cases by the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim (e.g., relative, guardian, teacher)?

}
RapeCommited_I_V.csv
{
What is the difference between "Rape (Total)(I)" and "Rape (Total)(V)"? How do these two categories relate to each other?
